Driver:
-Allow toggling of build mode
-Clear previous path before rendering new one
-Send location also when within n tiles of hunter

Face:
-Allow different faces to be pushed over channel, can push bundle to loop over until another is received
-I want to be able to do "face <- "expression"" and have it play that expression

Map:
-Create prefabbed map object

ASCII conversion:
-Look for patterns where there is a high darkness density along either |, /,\, and replace with that char
-Parse gif/mp4 into this format and get sized ascii frames
-Composed function to render frame, sent every 1000/FPS milliseconds - previous render time

Terminal:
-Redraw cursor character when placing a character (because we're just placing a character there)
-System views cursor as cursor and nothing else when placed on a wall or other object (because it is still registered as
 cursor object, may be fine because no real pathfinding should allow some people to be in walls)
