Driver:
-Allow toggling of build mode
-Clear previous path before rendering new one
-Send location also when within n tiles of hunter

Face:
-Allow different faces to be pushed over channel, can push bundle to loop over until another is received
-I want to be able to do "face <- "expression"" and have it play that expression

Map:
-Create prefabbed map object

ASCII conversion:
-Look for patterns where there is a high darkness density along either |, /,\, and replace with that char
-Parse gif/mp4 into this format and get sized ascii frames
-Composed function to render frame, sent every 1000/FPS milliseconds - previous render time

Terminal:

Server:
-Send server requests to validate state
-Server sends back new state updates whenever they happen
-Automatically render new state
-Server sends updates such as new position of follower 
-Custom keys ('1' linked to something, not mapped to any state)
-Right now you have to send a whole new copy, not validate a change
-ASYMMETRY
-Send a message of action to take server sends back proper state
-For example: '1' means place black at current space
-If this is allowed, broadcasts out new state since server tracks all state
-The question is, how do we send back just update to make and not whole new state
-Shouldn't be an issue in cases of location updates
-However, what about placing a '1' at just one tile on an array?
-Either pass whole thing and have to diff check to choose what to rerender, or send special message to perform special function with data (coord + new state)
-Zone has zone ID, which links to char handlers for that zone

Wordle:
-Autofill known green letters or don't allow anything else for green letters

General:
-Have config file for all preset values, like default port number, global message id, local message id...
