Driver:
-Allow toggling of build mode
-Clear previous path before rendering new one

Terminal:
-Add history, tell terminal to delete a char and replace with what was there before instead of managing, only revert if current key is what you expect
-Transparent cursor, only show * character but show color behind it
Allow terminal to read 3 main channels:
-Standard writes with coordinates or shift distances, a context, and a body (stores map of coordinate pairs to format and char, how to signal undo at x,y?)
-Pushing pre-styled character at coordinate or shift distance
-Sending composed function that takes only one argument, the terminal, which is then called with the terminal for any arbitrary effect

ASCII conversion:
-Look for patterns where there is a high darkness density along either |, /,\, and replace with that char
-Parse gif/mp4 into this format and get sized ascii frames
-Composed function to render frame, sent every 1000/FPS milliseconds - previous render time
