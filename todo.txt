Driver:
-Allow toggling of build mode
-Clear previous path before rendering new one
-Send location also when within n tiles of hunter

Face:
-Allow different faces to be pushed over channel, can push bundle to loop over until another is received
-I want to be able to do "face <- "expression"" and have it play that expression

Map:
-Create prefabbed map object

ASCII conversion:
-Look for patterns where there is a high darkness density along either |, /,\, and replace with that char
-Parse gif/mp4 into this format and get sized ascii frames
-Composed function to render frame, sent every 1000/FPS milliseconds - previous render time

Terminal:

Server:
-ASYMMETRY
-Send a message of action to take server sends back proper state
-For example: '1' means place black at current space
-If this is allowed, broadcasts out new state since server tracks all state
-The question is, how do we send back just update to make and not whole new state
-Shouldn't be an issue in cases of location updates
-However, what about placing a '1' at just one tile on an array?
-Either pass whole thing and have to diff check to choose what to rerender, or send special message to perform special function with data (coord + new state)
-Send message to clients to increase buffer size instead of just erroring
-Send custom function keys with data

-Switch to only UDP methods?
-Zone system for client handlers as well
-Represent color contexts as text data, read into map of name->color context object
-Represent IP, map size, etc, in the same way
-Concurrent map write issue with saved buffers in client
-Just check to see if futures to process edit the same state instead of allowasync and keep track of updated keys since last processed
-Change packet id to local when ip from = ip to (provides local handlers for live buffers)
-Save on server as bytes, parse to update, check id matches where we're sending it, update, back to bytes (provides local handlers for saved buffers)
-Build in context compose to renderer
-Allow tile select option

Wordle:
-Autofill known green letters or don't allow anything else for green letters

Insane:
Local server instance for just validating input?
Map ascii to isometric view and include localized mouse events, map fg/bg to sprites with extra function
Develop for alacritty

Auto multiplex when not explicitly defined.  "X" = green grass background or green bg, "*" = man standing there or red "*"

Should people still be able to place customs?  Yes but maybe not make them undoable, as in, play default on undo to custom

Set fg or bg to some char, have mappings for each.

Could map fg char to different char but why?

Red star = player
Green star = other
Need char map
