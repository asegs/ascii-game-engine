Driver:
-Allow toggling of build mode
-Clear previous path before rendering new one
-Send location also when within n tiles of hunter

Face:
-Allow different faces to be pushed over channel, can push bundle to loop over until another is received
-I want to be able to do "face <- "expression"" and have it play that expression

Map:
-Create prefabbed map object

ASCII conversion:
-Look for patterns where there is a high darkness density along either |, /,\, and replace with that char
-Parse gif/mp4 into this format and get sized ascii frames
-Composed function to render frame, sent every 1000/FPS milliseconds - previous render time

Terminal:


Wordle:
-Strikethrough yellow on virtual keyboard
-Autofill known green letters or don't allow anything else for green letters
-Don't show yellow for characters that have already been discovered if there are no more
    For example: real word is shove
    Guess is heave
    First e in heave should be gray

    If word is abyss
    And guess is stars
    First s in stars should be yellow
