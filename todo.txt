Driver:
-Allow toggling of build mode
-Clear previous path before rendering new one
-Send location also when within n tiles of hunter

Face:
-Allow different faces to be pushed over channel, can push bundle to loop over until another is received
-I want to be able to do "face <- "expression"" and have it play that expression

Map:
-Create prefabbed map object

ASCII conversion:
-Look for patterns where there is a high darkness density along either |, /,\, and replace with that char
-Parse gif/mp4 into this format and get sized ascii frames
-Composed function to render frame, sent every 1000/FPS milliseconds - previous render time

Terminal:
-Handle history by only extending array if there is a series of undoable events
-When a non-undoable event happens, wipe stack and set that event to be there
-When an undoable event happens, add to stack and let it grow indefinitely

Server:
-Have a client that just receives text and coords
-Have server that handles everything else and sends out text/coord pairs to listeners
-Anything one person should see and others shouldn't?
-Localized behavior (inventory menus..) this is basically full SSR

Wordle:
-Autofill known green letters or don't allow anything else for green letters
